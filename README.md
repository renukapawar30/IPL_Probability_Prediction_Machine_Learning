# IPL Probability Prediction (Machine Learning)

## Overview
This project predicts the winning probability of IPL teams during a live match using machine learning techniques.  
The model takes match parameters like runs, overs, wickets, and current score to estimate the chances of winning.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering from IPL datasets.
- Machine learning model training (Logistic Regression / Random Forest / etc.).
- Jupyter Notebook for easy experimentation.
- Predictions based on real-time match inputs.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
